The primary way I offer support is through GitHub Issues. You can create a [new issue](https://github.com/EncryptSL/LiteEco/issues/new/choose) there to report your problem.

Another option is to contact me via my Spigot profile and send me a [private message (PM)](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/rydloscz.127028/).

However, the best way to reach me is by sending me a message on Discord.

:::caution

I kindly ask all users to check the issues section to see if their problem has already been reported, so as to avoid duplicating existing issues, which slows down moderation.
