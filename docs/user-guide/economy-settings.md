# üí∞ Economy Settings ‚Äì MultiCurrencies

LiteEco supports **multiple currencies** with fully customizable names, formats, limits, and more. This allows server owners to define how virtual money behaves and appears for players.

All currency settings are defined in the `config.yml` under the `economy:` section.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Structure

```yaml
economy:
  currencies:
    dollars:
      currency_name: dollars
      currency_plural_name: dollars
      currency_singular_name: dollar
      currency_format: '$ <money>'
      starting_balance: 30
      balance_limit: 1000000
      balance_limit_check: true
      compact_display: false
      top_balances:
        filtering: true
        blacklist:
          - ExamplePlayerName
          - TestAccount123
          - Notch
  monolog_activity: true
```

> Note: In this example, the `top_balances` section has been updated ‚Äî it now uses a simple boolean `filtering` and a `blacklist` list for excluding names from the Top Balances / Top Leaders rankings.

## üè¶ Currencies

### ‚û§ `currencies`
This section allows you to define **one or more currencies**. Each currency is represented by a unique key (e.g. `dollars`, `credits`).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Do **not** rename existing currency keys if your server already stores data ‚Äî these keys are linked to database tables.

---

## üîë Currency Options

Each currency supports the following options:

| Option                    | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `currency_name`           | Name of the currency (e.g. *dollars*).                                      |
| `currency_plural_name`    | Plural form (e.g. *dollars*).                                               |
| `currency_singular_name`  | Singular form (e.g. *dollar*).                                              |
| `currency_format`         | Format for displaying money. Use `<money>` as a placeholder. Example: `$ <money>` |
| `starting_balance`        | Amount given to new players without an existing account.                    |
| `balance_limit`           | Maximum allowed balance for a player.                                       |
| `balance_limit_check`     | Enables or disables enforcement of the balance limit.                       |
| `compact_display`         | If `true`, large numbers will be shortened (e.g. `1M` instead of `1000000`). |

## üîé New: Name Filtering in Top Balances / Top Leaders

To improve control over who appears in the Top Balances (Top Leaders) ranking, a simple configuration for name filtering has been added.

### ‚û§ Structure

```yaml
top_balances:
  filtering: true     # enables/disables name filtering
  blacklist:
    - ExamplePlayerName
    - TestAccount123
    - Notch
```

### ‚û§ Field Descriptions
- `filtering` (`true` / `false`) ‚Äî when set to `true`, the `blacklist` will be applied when building the Top Balances list. Names listed in the blacklist will be **excluded**. When set to `false`, the blacklist is ignored.
- `blacklist` ‚Äî a list of player names that should be excluded from the Top Balances results. Use exact usernames.

**Notes & Recommendations**
- Filtering is case-sensitive and compares exact player names.
- In future versions, a `mode` option (e.g. `blacklist` / `whitelist`) may be added, but the current implementation only supports `filtering` + `blacklist`.

---

## üìÑ Example ‚Äì Additional Currency with Filtering

```yaml
credits:
  currency_name: credits
  currency_plural_name: credits
  currency_singular_name: credit
  currency_format: '‚Ç¨ <money>'
  starting_balance: 30
  balance_limit: 1000000
  balance_limit_check: true
  compact_display: false
  top_balances:
    filtering: false
    blacklist: []
```

---

## üìú Activity Logging

### ‚û§ `monolog_activity`
- **Type**: `true` / `false`
- **Default**: `true`
- When enabled, all economy actions such as `/eco add`, `/eco set`, `/eco withdraw`, `/eco pay`, etc., will be logged.
- View logs using:

```bash
/eco monolog [player]
```

---

:::tip
- Always include a default currency (like `dollars`) for Vault compatibility.
- Use meaningful names and formats to enhance player immersion.
- Compact formatting is useful for large-scale economies.
- Use `balance_limit_check: false` for unlimited balances.
- Use `top_balances.filtering: true` with a `blacklist` to exclude test or admin accounts from public leaderboards.

Would you like me to also include an example output of `/money top` before and after filtering (for clarity in documentation)?
